    ## Pagination

    When a data table request comes back with thousands of records, to break up the view and make working with the data more usable as well as a bit more performant from an experience perspective, we can paginate the results.

  = partial "modules/pagination"
  .push-top
  :markdown
    #### Usage

    ~~~haml
    .pagination
      = link_to "« prev", "#", class: "disabled prev"
      = link_to "1", "#", class: "current"
      = link_to "2", "#"
      = link_to "3", "#"
      = link_to "4", "#"
      = link_to "5", "#"
      = link_to "6", "#"
      = link_to "7", "#"
      = link_to "8", "#"
      = link_to "9", "#"
      %span ...
      = link_to "42", "#"
      = link_to "next »", "#", class: "next"
